# Background Processing Implementation Plan for LePostClient

## Current Status
- WP Background Processing library installed via Composer
- Library is ready to be used for implementing asynchronous processing

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Post Generation Process Class
1. Create a new class `Post_Generation_Process` that extends `WP_Background_Process`
2. Implement the required methods:
   - `task()`: Handle processing a single post generation request
   - `complete()`: Actions to take when all queued items are processed

### Phase 2: Integrate with Post Generator
1. Modify `src/Post/Generator.php` to use the background process
2. Add method to queue post generation requests instead of processing them immediately
3. Update status tracking to work with asynchronous processing

### Phase 3: Update Controllers
1. Modify `src/Admin/Controller/IdeasListController.php` to dispatch to background process
2. Remove extended time limit settings as they'll no longer be needed
3. Add status indicators for in-progress generations

### Phase 4: Add Status Tracking
1. Create a method to track the status of background processes
2. Add UI elements to show progress to users
3. Implement error handling for failed background tasks

## Benefits
- Improved user experience with non-blocking UI
- Better handling of long-running API requests
- Support for bulk operations without timeout issues
- Reduced server load by processing tasks in the background
